## Introduction
Peptideshaker Online is a user-friendly web-based framework for processing mass spectrometry-based proteomics data, from raw file conversion to interactive visualization of the results. The framework consists of two main components; a [Galaxy-based backend](https://github.com/barsnes-group/peptide-shaker-online/wiki/PeptideShaker-Online:-Backend) where the search and analysis processing is performed and the data storage is located and  a [web-based front-end](https://github.com/barsnes-group/peptide-shaker-online/wiki) supporting interactive visualizations of PeptideShaker projects

Web-based interface for [SearchGUI](https://github.com/compomics/searchgui) and [PeptideShaker](https://github.com/compomics/peptide-shaker)
