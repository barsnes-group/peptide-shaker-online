# PeptideShaker Online

PeptideShaker Online is a user-friendly web-based framework for the identification of mass spectrometry-based proteomics data. PeptideShaker Online consists of two main components: [Galaxy-based backend](https://github.com/barsnes-group/peptide-shaker-online/wiki/PeptideShaker-Online-Backend) and [a web application as a frontend](https://github.com/barsnes-group/peptide-shaker-online/wiki/PeptideShaker-Online-Frontend).

## Setup
The setup of PeptideShaker Online requires access to the following:

1.  Galaxy server (local _(recommended)_ or external)
2.  Tomcat web server (local)
3.  MySQL database engine (local)

We recommend that both the Galaxy server and the Tomcat server are located on the same machine or in the same network for both performace and security reasons. Note that using a remote Galaxy server includes sending data over the internet which may not be recommended if the data is senstive or requires extra protection. 

Step-by-step instructions on how to deploy PeptideShaker Online on your own web server are available here: [PeptideShaker Online Setup](https://github.com/barsnes-group/peptide-shaker-online/wiki/PeptideShaker-Online-Setup).

## Start using PeptideShaker Online
Before using PeptideShaker Online, please read [Start using PeptideShaker Online](https://github.com/barsnes-group/peptide-shaker-online/wiki/Start-using-PeptideShaker-Online). 

## Demo
A fully functional demo is available to test PeptideShaker Online. Due to resource limitations, the maximum number of concurrent users is set to five and uploading and deleting of files is not supported.
